ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @drdileepunni. I am a doctor by training and a data nerd by making. Most of the code I write are for work and cant be put in 
public repositories. My cleanly written public code repos are mostly projects with folks interning with us and research collabs. Sharing the 
links to those here
- https://github.com/drdileepunni/antibiotic_study

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in: Very generally, leveraging data to improve healthcare experience both for providers and patients. Specifically, I am intersted in
probabilistic graphical models and bayesian decision trees. 

ðŸ“« How to reach me: dm me in twitter @csuchola
